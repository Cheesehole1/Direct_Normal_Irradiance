In order to understand which state or county is economically optimal for installation of solar panels as the source of electricity. 
Raw data is obtained from "POWER" repository of NASA's. 
Notice that this raw data is not classified with County or state location.
Area selection is used to classify this data into states.
A new field is added into the dataset which atributes each state with the average cost for elecctricity with solar energy.
A new field is added made by calculating the ratio between the cost and direct normal irradiance.
This new field helps classify better the data and understand what state are more economically effecient for energy from solar.
